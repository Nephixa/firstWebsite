THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD UNTIL I LEARN THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO REBUILD THE WEBSITE

Notes:
- react.js needs to be written with a component mindset, each element which you want to use can be encapsulated in its own component and reused throughout the code in different spots. similar to oop
- sass is nice for nested css
- svg is just a bunch of text, use svgo to clean it up and then create a component via a function to use it in other components
- svg is a vector based image rather than raster, can be scaled infinitely
- components can be defined in either a class or a function
- with es7 extension, use rfce hotkey when setting up new component
- adjacent divs in html must be surrounded by another div tag
- libraries are really useful
